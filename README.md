This project is a badge generated with your or anyone else's Github informations, like profile picture, name, username, repositories and more.

### How to use 

You just need to type the Github username on the input, and then click on *Submit*.

After that, the badge will be automatically generated. You can click on the username to go to the Github profile, or you can also see the best repositories of that person and visit them.

In case of error while trying to fetch Github data, there'll be a message to warn the client.
